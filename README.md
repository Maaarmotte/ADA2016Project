# ADA2016Project

## Abstract
The goal of our project is to generate some happy maps for cities in Switzerland by following the work done by the GoodCityLife team. Mapping services mostly show only the shortest or fastest routes from one place to another, which at times is not our main priority. We might instead seek pleasure in the scenery and quietness of another path. 

## Data description
By making use of the crowdsourced information, we could construct a map with routes fulfilling peoples desire for an emotionally satisfying experience. We can used tagged and geolocated images from Flickr, Twitter, Instagram or other social media sites.
We would need to analyse people's sentiment in regard to diffrent locations, which requires Natural Language Processing (NLP). To classify locations either as likeable or not likeable, we might need some machine learning tools.

## Feasibility and Risks
The major problem is to estimate how much work will be required. For example, using NLP to find either positive or negative experiences connected with certain locations can be very complicated if pushed too far. Moreover, none of us have any experience with NLP, so we expected it to be challenging.
A great part of our project would be to develop an interactive map, which is visually appealing and connect the data about locations to form happiest routes. The use of routing algorithms could be a challenge.

## Deliverables
At the end of the project, we expect to deliver the following:
- An interactive happy map for a city in Switzerland e.g. Lausanne, where available picture density is high enough for good analysis. 

## Timeplan
#### Checkpoint (Mid December)
- A visual representation of gathered data about happier routes and locations. 

#### Mini-Symposium (End of January)
- The final results, including everything in the _Deliverables_ section. During the presentation, we will explain how we find these results and make sense of them.
